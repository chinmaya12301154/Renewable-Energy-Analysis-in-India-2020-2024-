# Renewable Energy Analysis in India (2020–2024)
This project explores India’s renewable energy production across states from 2020 to 2024, using a dataset of ~55,000 records. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and t-tests, it examines regional differences, energy source contributions (wind, solar), yearly trends, and seasonal patterns. Key findings show the Southern region leads Northern significantly and production grew over time. Built with Python (Pandas, Seaborn, SciPy), it includes heatmaps, boxplots, and statistical tests to uncover insights for sustainable energy planning.

## Features
- EDA with correlation heatmaps.
- T-tests for regions, years, and energy types.
- Visualizations like boxplots and bar charts.
